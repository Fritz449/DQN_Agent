# DQN Agent
## Structure of project
### QNeuralNetwork.py
Q-network implemented via Keras and Theano

You can turn on:
- Double DQN
- Prioritized experience replay

### Gym.py 
Interaction with Gym made my OpenAI. 
There is an option to make a preprocessing of images: grayscale + rescale + 4-frames concatenation

## TO DO:
- Deep exploration via Bootstraped DQN
- Dueling Architecture
